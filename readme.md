### `aqua` - A Cross-Platform Real-Time Audio Sharing Software

> This project captures audio streams from various systems, transmits them over the network to another system as audio
> input for playback.
> The goal is to achieve audio stream sharing across the vast majority of operating systems.

This is aquawius' first moderately sized C++ project. I have high hopes for it, hence naming it `aqua` after the first
half of my name. I also hope `aqua` remains evergreen, just like the color this word represents.

#### 1. Project Overview

The idea of audio sharing originated during my university years, but it remained shelved until now, finally taking
shapeâ€”a tribute to my college life.

The project was initially inspired by [audio-share](https://github.com/mkckr0/audio-share), which implemented audio
streaming to Android devices. I referenced parts of its code (especially the ASIO coroutine section) during the early
stages. Special thanks to the audio-share project and its contributors.

The system consists of a **server** and **client**. In short:
**The server captures the system's audio stream and sends it over the network to one or more clients for playback.**

Key features of `aqua`:

> 1. **Cross-platform support**: Versions for Windows and Linux with interoperability (e.g., capture on Linux and play
     on Windows, or vice versa).
> 2. **Low-latency audio transmission**: Estimated under 20ms on Linux and 50ms on Windows.
> 3. **GUI (Qt) and CLI support**: No more wrestling with terminal windows.
> 4. **Network resilience**: Client-side adaptive buffering to combat jitter.
> 5. **Automatic default device switching**: Seamlessly switches capture/playback streams when default devices change.
> 6. **Visual volume indicator**: Monitor audio capture/playback status.

Qt6 version. (Windows/Linux)

#### 2. Usage

Deploy the server on the sharing device and the client on the playback device. Both must have bidirectional network
access.

##### Server Setup:

- Run `aqua-server`, optionally binding to a specific IP (default: LAN IP) and port (default: 10120).
- For cross-subnet use, bind to `0.0.0.0`.

##### Client Setup:

- Run `aqua-client`, specifying the server's IP and RPC port (default: 10120).
- Provide the client's local IP (must be reachable by the server) and port (default: random between 49152-65535).
- Qt GUI users: Check `Use custom settings` to specify IP/port.

In console version, you can use `--help` or `-h` to see usage.

You should now hear audio captured by the server.

#### 3. Technical Architecture

**Shared Components**:

- gRPC services
- Network layer
- Capture/playback services

**Client-Specific**:

- Adaptive buffer

**Server-Specific**:

- Session management

#### 4. Current Status

##### Completed Features

###### aqua Server

> - Linux PipeWire capture (via Sink, native stream routing)
> - Windows WASAPI capture with stream routing (fixed format)
> - IPv4 support
> - Session management

###### aqua Client

> - Linux PipeWire playback
> - Windows WASAPI playback with stream routing (fixed format)
> - IPv4 support
> - Keep-alive mechanism (sync with server sessions)
> - Adaptive buffering (network jitter mitigation)

##### Pending/Limitations

> - IPv6 support
> - NAT traversal improvements (current design assumes LAN; client IP/port required)
> - ~~GUI support (Qt6 now available for `aqua-qt-server` and `aqua-qt-client`)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> - Android client (low priority; overlaps with `audio-share`)
> - gRPC timeout handling (delayed client exit on disconnects)
> - **Fixed audio format on Windows**: 48kHz, 2ch, 16-bit (deviation causes crashes)
